Module 1 notes.
Cloud computing is a subset of information technology.
Potential projects/problems a future IT specialist will encounter:
Data Overload
Mobile and wireless usages
Cloud services
Bandwidth for video
Hardware includes all physical aspects of an IT system.
Software encompasses all the data, application codes and programs that are digitally stored.
Software can also run in a cloud environment just as it can in the physical environment. The difference is that you have your software running on a virtual machine instead of a physical one.
The Four Pillars of an IT framework:
Infrastructure
Broadly defined as a set of IT components that are the foundation of IT services.
Development
Is a process of writing and maintaining source code for software applications or framework.
	Security
	Is a set of cybersecurity strategies that prevents unauthorized access to organizational assets such as computers, networks, software, and data. 
*Is represented through quantities, characters, or symbols on which operations are performed by a computer are stored and recorded on magnetic, optical, or mechanical recording media, and transmitted in the form of digital electrical, signals.
*If pursuing a career in cloud computing it is important to understand the components specifically related to the CPU, RAM, Storage, and Expansion Cards like the GPU.
*	Motherboard: is the main circuit board of a computer and is also known as the main board, logic board, or system board.
*Motherboards have input and output ports that are available to plug devices into in order to interact with the PC.
*	The CPU accesses the BIOS even before the operating system is loaded.
*In cloud computing, you donâ€™t need to worry about updating the BIOS on a PC or server in the cloud.
*	One big difference between a 32-bit and a 64-bit is the number of calculations per second they can perform, which affects the speed at which they can complete tasks.
*cloud computing wants you to stop thinking of your infrstructures as hardware, but yet think of it more as software.
*Software solutions can change more quickly, easily, and cost-effctively than hardware solutions.
IaaS) more control over IT resources (PaaS) Less control over IT resources SaaS
*their are 3 different cloud computing deployment models: cloud, hybrid, on-prmises(private cloud)
*the 6 advantges of the cloud:
1- Trade capital expense for variable expense. "capital expenses, or capex, are funds that a company uses to acquire, upgrade, and maintain physical assets, such as property, industrial buildings, or equipment".
2-benefit from massive economies of scale. 
3-Stop guessing capacity."Eliminate guessing about your infrastructure capacity needs. When you make decisions aboiut capacity before you deploy an application you often eiter have expensive idle resources, or
deal with limited capacity. with cloud computing, these problems go away".
4-Increase speed and agility.
5-Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers.
6-Go global in minutes.
*A web service is any piece of software that makes itself avaiable over the internet and uses a standardized format.
*AWS is a secure cloud platform that offers a broad set of global cloud-based products.
*the service you select depends on your business goals and technology requirements.
